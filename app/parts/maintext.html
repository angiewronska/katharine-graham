    The resume of Katharine “Kay” Graham—who transformed The Washington Post Company’s business and publishing
    operations into one of the world’s leading newspapers—is nothing short of remarkable.
  </p>
  <p class="text__paragraph paragraph p2">
    She was one of the first female publishers of an American newspaper and the first-ever female chief executive
    officer of a Fortune 500 company. Graham defied the U. S. government to publish both the Pentagon Papers and the
    Watergate story, two of the century’s biggest scoops. During the decades she directed The Washington Post Company’s
    business, revenue grew by more than $1 billion and the stock price soared, solidifying Graham’s status as one of the
    country’s most savvy business leaders. In later life, she proved a talented storyteller in her own right, winning a
    Pulitzer Prize for her autobiographical narrative, “Personal History.”

  <p class="text__paragraph paragraph p3">
    But until her mid-40s, Graham saw herself only as an obedient daughter and self-described “doormat wife,” with no
    real career prospects or sense of professional autonomy. That all changed when her husband, Philip Graham—president
    and former publisher of The Washington Post—killed himself, thrusting his wife into a role she never imagined she
    was qualified to hold.

  <p class="text__paragraph paragraph p4">
    Surprising her male colleagues as well as herself, she embraced her new role long before “lean in” became a rallying
    cry for professional women. Her bold leadership of The Washington Post in the 1970s changed the course of American
    journalism, but like so many female leaders through history, she’s often been overlooked. She got only one mention
    in the film “All The President’s Men”—an otherwise detailed account of the Watergate scoop.
  </p>
  <p class="text__paragraph paragraph p5">
    “The Post” puts Graham back in the spotlight, reminding viewers of the impact female leaders can have when given the
    opportunity, said Alicia Shepard, former NPR ombudsman and author of “Woodward and Bernstein: Life in the Shadow of
    Watergate.”

    “She was always recognized as an icon and pioneer to women and journalists of my generation,” she said. “What she’s
    getting is second showing—a comeback act, if you will.”
