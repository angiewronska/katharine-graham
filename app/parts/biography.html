      The “doormat wife”
    </h2>
    <p class="biography__text-paragraph paragraph p7">
      Graham was born in 1917 to enormous wealth and privilege. Her multi-millionaire financier father purchased The
      Washington Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933 and eventually appointed his son-in-law publisher, giving Phillip
      more shares of stock in the company than his daughter.

    <p class="biography__text-paragraph paragraph p8">
      Graham took it in stride. “As Dad explained to me, no man should be in the position of working for his wife,” she
      wrote in her memoir. “Curiously, I not only concurred but was in complete accord with this idea.” She often
      deferred to her husband, and she became a kind of second-class citizen in her marriage, Graham wrote, habitually
      putting Philip’s ambitions and desires above her own.

      “As he emerged more on the journalistic and political scenes,I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his
      kite—and the moreI felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,” Graham wrote.
    </p>

      And then, after years of living with manic depression, Philip took his own life.
